# Cybersecurity Monte Carlo Simulation

This repository contains a Monte Carlo simulation for cybersecurity risk analysis. The simulation evaluates the likelihood and impact of various cybersecurity threats using Monte Carlo methods.

### How to Run the Simulation in Google Colab

To run the simulation directly in Google Colab:

1. Open the following Google Colab notebook:
   [Open in Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/dannyarku/monte-carlo-risk-simulation/blob/main/simulation.py)

2. Follow the instructions inside the Colab notebook to run the Monte Carlo simulation.

### Features
- Simulate cybersecurity risks from four threats: Phishing, Ransomware, Unauthorized Access, and Data Breach.
- Generate a histogram to visualize the total risk.
- Calculate and print the average risk across all simulations.

### How It Works

The simulation uses the following parameters:
- **Phishing**: Likelihood of 0.79 and impact of 7
- **Ransomware**: Likelihood of 0.4 and impact of 9
- **Unauthorized Access**: Likelihood of 0.56 and impact of 6
- **Data Breach**: Likelihood of 0.48 and impact of 10

The simulation runs 1000 trials and then visualizes the results in a histogram.

### Requirements
- No local setup required. Simply run the Colab notebook!
